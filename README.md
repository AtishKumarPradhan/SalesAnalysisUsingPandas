# **Sales Analysis Using Pandas**
This repository contains sales data from January 2019 to December 2019. Using pandas, I've merged all the data into a single DataFrame and performed analysis to answer the following business questions:  

• **Best Month for Sales**: Identified the best-performing month and calculated the total earnings for that month.  
• **Highest Sales by City**: Determined which city had the highest sales volume.  
• **Optimal Advertisement Timing**: Analyzed data to suggest the best times for displaying advertisements to maximize customer purchases.  
• **Frequently Sold Together Products**: Identified pairs of products that are frequently sold together.  
• **Top Selling Product**: Identified the product that sold the most and provided insights into its popularity.  

## Repository Contents
**Sales_Data Folder**: Contains raw CSV files with monthly sales data.  
**Sales Analysis PDF**: Detailed analysis and findings.  
**Sales Analysis Notebook**: Jupyter notebook with code used for data merging, cleaning, analysis and visualization.  

## **Example Analysis**
Here's a brief example of the analysis conducted:

### **Merging and Cleaning Dat**a:

• Loaded monthly sales data files.  
• Merged them into a single DataFrame using pandas.  
• Cleaned the data by dropping NaN,duplicates and unnecesary values and converting data types.  

### **Sales Analysis**:

• Calculated total sales by month.  
• Visualized monthly sales trends using bar charts to identify peak sales periods.  

## **Next Step**:
Explore the Jupyter notebook (SalesAnalysis.ipynb) or PDF file (SalesAnalysis.pdf) to delve deeper into the analysis, understand the methodologies used, and view visualizations that provide insights into sales trends and patterns.
